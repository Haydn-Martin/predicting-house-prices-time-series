# predicting-house-prices-time-series
Using a variety of predictive time series forecasting techniques with real data to (try and) predict UK house prices:

- Classical Statistics (ARIMA)
- Classical ML (Linear Regression)
- Neural Network (LSTM)

We don't have nearly enough data, and this problem is very difficult, hence we aren't able to create good models.
I simply illustrate the techniques one would use to do so.
