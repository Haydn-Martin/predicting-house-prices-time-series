1,Data up to and including 2002 are from 5% sample. Data from 2003 are based on a significantly enhanced sample size. Data from September 2005 are collected via the Regulated Mortgage Survey. 2005 data are based on combined data from the Survey of Mortgage Lenders and the Regulated Mortgage Survey.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,"Prices rounded to the nearest £1,000",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,"Other dwellings is defined as any record in the dataset with an 'old' dwelling marker. This will not include any records where the dwelling type is unknown. The all dwellings average will include all records (so new, old and 'unknown'). ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
